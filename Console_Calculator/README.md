## Reflection 


While building this project, I faced two key challenges:
- Looping Logic: I initially struggled to keep the calculator running until the user chose to exit. After experimenting with while and do-while loops, I learned how to control flow effectively without creating infinite loops.
- Argument Handling: Managing different input requirements for operations (like one input for square root vs. two for addition) was tricky. I learned to use conditional checks and method separation to handle these cases cleanly.
This project helped me strengthen:
- Java fundamentals (loops, conditionals, methods)
- Input validation and error handling
- Console interaction and user prompts
